# Dashboard on the market of sausages and sausage products

The aim of the project was to build an informative dashboard on the market of sausages and sausage products based on the study. It was important to reflect the main parameters of the market:
* Market size
* Volume of production
* Indicators of foreign economic activity.

Minimalistic dashboard was prepared in PowerBI with basic information on the market, the ability to cut by year, units of measurement (cost or weight of goods), direction of movement of goods (import, export), etc.

The work can be viewed in [PDF](https://github.com/efourb/projects-data-analyst/blob/main/Dashboard%20Sausages%20and%20Sausage%20Products/Sausages%20and%20sausage%20products.pdf) or [PBIX](https://github.com/efourb/projects-data-analyst/blob/main/Dashboard%20Sausages%20and%20Sausage%20Products/Sausages%20and%20sausage%20products.pbix) format for full functionality.
